This project uses data from Northwind traders to isolate reasons for their recent decline in profitability.

## Requirements

These instructions will guide you through the technical requirements that will need to be fulfilled, before running this project on your machine.  

Before getting started, you will need to have Python installed on your machine.  We recommend using Anaconda for this purpose, as it is delivered with more than 1,500 packages/libraries pre-installed.  

### Libraries

To run these projects, you will first need to install the following libraries.  If you have chosen to run Python through Anaconda, there is no need to individually install the below:

- Sqlite: Enables SQL commands to be run within Python
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis
- Numpy: Supports multi-dimensional matrices and arrays, provides a large number of mathematical functions
- Matplotlib: A 2D graphical plotting library
- Seaborn: Another data visualisation libary, based on Matplotlib
- Statsmodels: Enables the conduct of statistical analysis
- Scipy: Used for scientifica computing
- Itertools: Implements a number of interator building blocks (e.g. permutations, combinations etc.)

## Data

The dataset used is the Microsoft Northwind SQL dataset.  A copy of the schema is available within the Jupyter Notebook.
